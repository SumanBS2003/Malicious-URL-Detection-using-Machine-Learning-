# Malicious-URL-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-

Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to detect malicious URLs. The goal is to build a system that can identify potentially harmful URLs that might lead to phishing sites, malware, or other cybersecurity threats.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of labeled URLs, where each URL is marked as either malicious(1) or benign(0). 

Model Training
The model is trained using various ensemble machine learning algorithms which include
--> Random Forest
--> AdaBoost
--> XGBoost
--> LightGBM

Model Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as:
--> Accuracy
--> Precision
--> Recall
--> F1-Score

Results
The results of the model evaluation, including performance metrics and visualizations, are presented in the results directory. The final model achieves an accuracy of X% on the test set.
